# AVINSoR
A Lego NXT based project enabling cartesian-mapped movement, and decisions based on basic supervised machine-learning algorithims. Implemented in C# (GUI and backend) and MATLAB (backend).

This 3rd year (BEng) University project dates way back to 2013, and was presented to my supervisor on June 2014.
